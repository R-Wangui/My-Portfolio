                <h5>A product designer and frontend developer
                My background in product design has given me a keen eye for detail and a strong understanding of user experience, which I now apply to create seamless and visually appealing web interfaces. 
                I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and have experience working with various front-end frameworks and libraries.
                I'm currently seeking an internship or an entry-level front-end development position where I can continue to grow and learn on the job. 
                I'm excited to bring my unique blend of design and development skills to a dynamic team and contribute to creating amazing digital experiences
